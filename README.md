## Installation

Must have Node.JS installed, start by opening the root folder in a integraded terminal and run "npm i" to install needed dev dependencies. Then run "npm run seed" to seed the database with test data. Then create a .env file and input the database, username, and password. After the env file is created simply type "nodemon", or "node server.js" to start the server, then open a api endpoint tester like insomnia and you now have full access to the database :).

## Usage

To manage a online retail store that sells a vast ammount of items.
